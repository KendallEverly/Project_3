    <h1>The Past: How the Internet Became</h1>
</div>
<div class="box">
    The internet is the biggest revolution of this time, which began in the 21st century, dating back to the 1950’s. It enables millions of people to communicate, with information for every aspect of life. This use of the internet is indispensable in terms of use. It can be used to spread information, as a form of communication used to talk with others, create websites, shop, and even be used for war. It can give instant access to things that once took days or even weeks to receive.

        J. C. R. Licklider was a psychologist who came up with the idea of the internet where computers were combined to communicate with other computers around the world. The first computers were very expensive, as large as a room, and could not communicate with others, known as the ARPANET. Leonard Kleinrock showed how packages of data could queue through a network through demand access and distributed control. To use distributed control, every switch should share the control. This was the revolutionary moment when they realized computers could connect and communicate with each other. This was when the telephone system changed over to the switchboard system.

        Paul Baran was an internet pioneer who came up with hot potato routing where a message was able to get through a network, even if a network was damaged along the way. Baran learned to dissolve the messages into packets, and then launches through the network from sender to the recipient. Basically, if some part of the network works, eventually the message would get through. In the world of computers, timesharing became a new revolution during the 1960’s. You could log into a computer across town through a computer at home, yet none could communicate with each other. Bob Taylor learned that all computers could talk to each other if heterogeneous computers were linked together on the same network. Larry Roberts built the first connection between two computers at MIT. 1968 was the year Larry Roberts sought out the engineers to help build the internet from building smaller computers called IMP, and then connecting the networks together. Graduate students were the first group of people to work on the code for the first IMP. 1969, the first piece of equipment for the internet was turned on at UCLA. And by the end of the year, all 4 systems were turned on. By the end of 1971, 18 computers were connected to it.

        Raymond Tomlinson soon after invented the email. He created both the code and the “@” sign for the first email. In October of 1972, the computer network was demonstrated in Washington D.C., and literally took over the world. The internet was built with a super architecture, that anyone could write anything they wanted, causing the rate of evolution to significantly increase. Networks soon emerged across the world. In 1973, the TCP/IP protocol enabled the networks to connect. In 1983, PCP/IP was adopted as the universal standard as the commonality for the internet.
