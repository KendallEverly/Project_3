        <h1>Tips and Tricks Using Pylint</h1>

            We often encounter errors as we code in Python. When this happens, usually we reference a book or previous notes. But most of us will spend a lot of time browsing the internet for the answer to their coding errors. These errors can become much lengthier when the code has not been noted and it is difficult to read. This is where Pylint comes to the rescue. Pylist is a tool that is used to help enforce a better coding standard, while also offering a detailed list of errors that have occurred after running the code.
        </p>
        <p>
            When first starting out with Pylint, make sure to install it first. Remember that Pylint is simply checking the code for mistakes—it is not executing the code itself. Pylint simply helps you to be more aware in how you are coding, so that way the code is written in a desirable programming style while also checking for errors. Pylint will provide you a code rating to show you the quality of your code.

            Some tips and tricks to remember when just starting out to Python, is that when implementing Pylint all operators should have a single space on each side. For example: you would not want to type “>”, but rather “ > “. A bad practice to programming is not having those spaces around each operator. Similarly, making sure that there is always a single space after a comma or colon is good programming practice. While missing the space after, or putting a space before the comma/colon is bad practice. Additionally, It is also good practice to always have a docstring at the beginning of a module to better describe what the module is doing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember that Pylint is a fantastic tool to help improve the overall quality of your code. Definitely use Pylint or another code quality checker to help your code to look more professional, and also legible to the reader. Happy coding!

            OOP (Object oriented programming): When the software design is organized around data and/or objects rather than organized around functions and logic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Factory instantiation: a creational design pattern that permits the subclasses to decide what to instantiate when creating an object.
        </p>
        <p>
            Object: a collection of data that has properties and methods
        </p>
        <p>
            Class: an object constructor, or a specific model that describes a set of properties which an object characterizes. basically, the blueprint for creating objects
        </p>
        <p>
            Namespace: the unique name used for each object in Python
        </p>
        <p>
            Constructor: assigns values to the data within a class when the object is created and that the object will need when it begins
        </p>
        <p>
            Fixture: defined functions steps needed for testing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Type hint: a solution that indicates the type of a value.
        </p>
        <p>
            Type cast: determines which data type class the value belongs to.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unit test: tests a specific set of code to see if it responds how it is expected to.
        </p>
        <p>
            Static: These can be called by using the class name rather than the object name.
        </p>
        <p>
            Class method: receives the class as the first argument
        </p>
        <p>
            Façade: used when a system is very complex or difficult to understand
        </p>
        <p>
            Design patterns used: software design patterns that are used. There are 23 patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Method: equivalent to a function, and classified according to function.
        </p>
        <p>
            Property: a class between a field and a method
