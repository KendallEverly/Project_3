    <h1>The Future: How the Internet Evolved</h1>
</div>
<div class="box">
    <p>One of the internet’s major milestones was passed by the Congress, so that the internet was open to public use. In 1992, there were 50 webpages on the internet. Mark Andresen’s browser turned the browser of the internet more user friendly. In 1 year, the web grew by 341,000%!

        Most important world changing inventions in the history of mankind is the internet. Mark Andresen had a vision of the web to make it more user friendly with a graphical web browser with “Mosaic.” Bill Gates founded Microsoft, who wanted to charge everyone to use the networks for the internet. Bill Gates quickly became one of the most powerful people in the world. Netscape was soon founded based on Mosaic. Netscape Navigator was launched in 1994 soon after, a competitor to Microsoft. Microsoft and Netscape had a meeting together where Microsoft offered Netscape $1 million to have full access to all their information. Within hours of the meeting, the groundwork for a lawsuit was set up against Microsoft.

        In 1995, Gates let people know that he had Netscape under control. Internet Explorer was soon created because of Netscape. Since Microsoft had billions of dollars in the bank account, Microsoft was able to offer the browser for free included in their Microsoft package. This was the end to The Browser War. A year later, the company was rolled over into a new company: AOL. In 1998, the United States government has accused Microsoft in predatory anti-trust lawbreakers. Microsoft was found guilty. A federal appeals court rescinded the order to split the company into two, as they believed the verdict was too strict.

        Finding what you were looking for on the web, used to be nearly impossible. Yahoo was founded by 2 people, and it was based on the search engine originally created to find things easier within categories that they were sorted into. The Web Boom had begun. By 1996, Yahoo gained many challengers, trying to compete against the company. By 1997, the internet was exploring with portals. However, the engines soon stopped focusing on search, and focused more on popularity. This caused there to be room for a new search engine, and Google was soon launched. Google would follow the most relevant sites and put them towards the top of the search. Google now has a stock market value of over $200 billion. Google began from “Angel Investors” who saw extreme potential from the start.

        Google was unique in that it was a stand-alone search engine with no ads. Bill Gross came up with a solution to make Google profitable without being covered with ads to the user. Keywords soon became the future of the business. By selling keywords like The Yellow Pages, Gross was able to solve the problem to the search engines. Gross and Google settled in court so that Google was able to use Gross’ idea with Gross profiting. In 2004, Google went public, and it soon became a household name.

        Youtube was bought in 2006 by Google. Today, the tv industry is about broadcasting yourself without a full crew and facility that was once previously required to be on television. It used to be a handful of engineers that chose what to expose the community to. Now, it’s up to the users to decide what should be exposed. Later on, other peer to peer websites were launched, such as Facebook and Napster. Napster allowed people with heavy music collections to offer downloadable content to free music. It eventually became the fastest spreading software, ever.
